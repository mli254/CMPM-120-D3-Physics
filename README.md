# CMPM-120-D3-Physics
Repository for Demo 3 for CMPM 120: Physics-based Game.
Play the game at [this link](https://mli254.github.io/CMPM-120-D3-Physics/).

### Gameplay/Experience Requirements
- **The game uses both continuous and discrete inputs from the player**
    - Continuous:
        - Drawing lines to control the movement of the ball
    - Discrete: 
        - Pressing the "play" button to cause the ball to drop
        - Pressing the "restart" button to restart the level
- **The playerâ€™s goal can only be achieved indirectly (by allowing the physics engine to move key objects into position/contact).**
    - The player can't move the ball directly towards the stars, and must draw lines in order to influence its movement.
- **3+ physics-based gameplay scenes (possibly implemented with a single Phaser Scene subclass).**
    - Level 1: one ball, one star
    - Level 2: one ball, two stars
    - Level 3: one ball, three stars
- **Other scenes are used to separate and contextualize the gameplay scenes**
    - 3 summary pages
